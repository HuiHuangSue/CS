# User experience design

## Course goals with steps
### Step1: Requiremenets gathering
Understanding the user and what her goals are. What are the current practices. 
Understanding the "problem space"- what is hindering the completion of the task how can the task or process be improved. 

### Step 2: Design Alternatives
Once you understand the users, their goals, and their current practices (e.i., the problem space) you are able to take this data and develop various design options that will improve the user experience 

### Step 3: Protoyping: 
Techniques for modelling the novel designs before a final version is produced

### Step 4: Evaluation
A set of techniques for ascertaining that your design meets the needs of the user


## Important terms and concepts
UX: users use interface to complete a task. Useful and usable. Effective, efficient, satisfying. 

## The design of Everyday Things
### How do products interact with users (7 points)
#### Affordance.
Functionality of a product (push & pull of door)
#### Signifier. 
Inform users about the poduct's functionality (push and pull text signs)
#### Constraints
Use constraints to force the desired user behaviour. (fence to prevent users running to basement)
#### Mappings
Analogical relationship btw the control and devices being controlled. (automobile seat adjustment control for left/right mirrors)
#### Feedback
alarm clock volumn (too little then ignore, too much then distracting)
#### Conceptual models
Conceptual relationship btw control and devices being controlled.(fridge higher number, then colder)

### How do people do things (7 stages of actions)
- Goal                --> Plan               --> Specify       --> Perform        --> World --> Perceive      --> Inter[ret          --> Compare     --> Goal
- What to accompanish --> what alternatives  --> What can I do --> How do I do it --> World --> what happened --> What does it mean --> Is this ok? --> What to accompanish?
- Read with dim light --> turn on light me/he--> myself as easy--> turn on        --> world --> light on      --> can read           --> good solution --> Accompanished

### Design thinking
Now we fully research the product interaction and user behavious. Can we start writing the product requirements? Let's make sure that we are solving the right problem with Design thinking.
Use the double-diamond model to find the right problem and solution.
Use human-centered design to iterate the discussion in the double-diamond model. 

### Design and business
Beside the human-centered design, we should also pay attention to the go-to-market strategies. 
- Market acceptance, speed, features, quality, price
